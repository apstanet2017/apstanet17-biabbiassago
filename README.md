# Using Networks to study the Evolution of Cooperation

The goal of this project is to understand how we can use networks as population models in an evolutionary game theory context.
In this repo I keep working files. 


### Part 1: 

Create a simulation that replicates the evolution process as described in *A simple rule for the evolution of cooperation on graphs and social networks*, Ohtsuki, Hauert,Liberman, Nowak, Nature **441**, 502-505, 2006.  

	- file : gifdemo.R for visual representation of the process. 
	- file : functions.R for functions used in simulation. 

### Part 2

Represent the generational evolution for a network of 20 nodes, and visualize. To do so, I created a Shiny App in which the process can be explored in four different types of networks.   
  
	- Shiny App: https://biabbiassago.shinyapps.io/cooperationsim/.   
	- file : server.R for 'back-end' of the app.  
	- file: ui.R for 'front-end' of the app.  

### Part 3

Test how benefit/cost ratio and number of neighbours of the nodes affects how cooperation spreads in the network.  Test on circle, lattice, scale free, and a 'real' network (Sampson's monk network).   

	- file: simulations.R.
